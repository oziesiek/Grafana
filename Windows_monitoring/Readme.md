Advanced Windows Server Monitoring JSON Configuration
Welcome to the Advanced Windows Server Monitoring JSON Configuration repository! This repository contains a powerful JSON configuration file designed for advanced monitoring of Windows server status and health check. This comprehensive configuration provides detailed insights into your Windows servers' performance, including uptime, number of processes and threads, CPU usage and processors, free memory, drive usage and queue, system calls, context switches, and network interface load.

Features
Uptime Monitoring: Keep track of your Windows servers' uptime to ensure uninterrupted service.

Process and Thread Count: Monitor the number of running processes and threads for optimal system performance.

CPU Usage and Processors: Track CPU usage and processor metrics to identify potential bottlenecks.

Memory Usage: Monitor available free memory to prevent memory-related issues.

Drive Usage and Queue: Keep an eye on drive usage and queue metrics for efficient storage management.

System Calls and Context Switches: Monitor the number of system calls and context switches per second for system responsiveness.

Network Interface Load: Track network interface load to optimize network performance.

Getting Started
To implement this advanced monitoring scheme in your Windows server infrastructure, follow these steps:

Download the JSON Configuration File: Clone or download the JSON configuration file from this repository.

Configuration: Open the JSON file and configure the following variables according to your setup:

Datasource: Specify the appropriate datasource to connect Grafana with your data source.
Environment: Set the environment (e.g., production, testing) for which you are configuring the monitoring.
Customization: This configuration allows you to search your servers by name, environment, and choose which statistics to display. Customize the setup to meet your specific requirements.

Import into Grafana: Import the configured JSON file into your Grafana instance.
